# Zillow_Evaluation
Scrape Zillow data for recently sold houses in the area to aid home search <br/>
Adjust price to today by using market data from Redfin <br/>
Analyze patterns in the market <br/>
Build GBM to understand how certain aspects of the home affect the sales price <br/>



Top-Level Conclusions:

-It will depend on the home and suburb, but most homes are selling for 5% under list price as of Q4 2021 <br/>
-Suburb and living area are the most important factors in a home's price and will account for a majority of the variability <br/>
-Listings reach their peak in Q2/3, so inventory should pick up.  However, inventory is much lower than usual right now <br/>
-Excluding some unicorn houses (which probably are smaller and fixer-upper), I'm probably not going to find a house in my price range in the suburbs I've lived in (Regent Square and Squirrel Hill South), though I would jump at those fixer-upper opportunities.  Best bets are Swisshelm Park, Swissvale (the good part, not past Church Street), and Edgewood <br/>
-In a macro sense, rising interest rates should increase monthly payments.  However, this will probably be offset slightly (hopefully) be a cooling off in home prices due to a decrease in demand caused by rising rates<br/>
