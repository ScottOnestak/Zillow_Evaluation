This sale comprises three contiguous city lots with one single family home. This property is an inholding in the Pittsburgh Greenway nature preserve overlooking the Allegheny river.  A natural oasis in the city!  The Greenway now goes to the river, and there will be a park, dog park, and boat launch there in the future.

Turn of the century home with original features.  Will need all new mechanicals.  Original frame house is sound, as is foundation throughout.  Framed addition in rear is bad and will need rebuilt.  Great view, secluded and peaceful on a dead end street.  Deer, turkey, and groundhogs everywhere.  Nothing but potential!   
 
Walk through the Greenway to Lawrenceville (15-20 min), or Morningside (5 min).  62nd St. bridge (which leads to all major arteries of traffic), is at the bottom of the hill, as well as the bike path leading to points South and eventually DC .  Downtown is an eight minute drive away.

Graduate studies in Chicago with Mies van der Rohe led further to the development of Speyer’s modern aesthetic.
